Project 1 - Cryptography app using python
In this python project various functions were defined that are used in a basic cryptography app. 
1) A unique key is generated using a defined funtion and the key is stored in a file as byte data. 
2) A function is defined to read the key that has been written into the file.
3) Another funtion is defined to take input from the user. The user can input any text or number as a secret message that has to be encrypted.
4) An encryption funtion is defined which encodes the message according to the unique key that had been generated and an encrypted message is returned.
5) A decryption function is defined that uses the provided key to decrypt the encoded message that had been obtained earlier. If the right key is passed to the decryption function 
it will return the correct message that had been entered and encrypted earlier.
